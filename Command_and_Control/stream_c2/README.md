# Stream C2

I used the TCP echo client/server using streams [example](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html#examples) and built a very basic C2

## Running (server)

Must have Python 3.7+

```
python3 server.py
** C2 Serving on ('0.0.0.0', 8888) **
```

Starting the server

## Building (client)

### Python

Must have Python 3.7+

```
python client.py
```

Running the client with python (no build necessary)

### Pyinstaller

```
pyinstaller.exe --onefile --noconsole .\client.py
```

Builds the client into a single file executable using [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)
